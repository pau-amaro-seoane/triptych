Removed the use of libstrifc.a from triptych and just used the necessary source
code from http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~jhurley/bsedload.html in its place.
The code now compiles with gfortran (use "make -f makefile").

On line 20 of triptych.f there is a "verbosity" parameter that is set to 1.
This controls how much output is printed to the screen.  If you ever want to
see more text, including some comments originally meant for debugging purposes,
set vebosity=2 and recompile.

When transitioning from the hydrodynamics to the evolution, the evolution is
initiated by assuming the star is fully mixed during the collision.  The code
in triptych.f calculates the average helium mass fraction Yinit throughout the
entire merger product and uses that to initialize the stellar evolution.  This
isn't ideal because it's ignoring the actual composition profile of the merger
product, even though that information is available since MMAS is being used.
